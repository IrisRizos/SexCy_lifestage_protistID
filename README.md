# How to identify sexual cycle cues among uncultivable protists ?


From a genetic point of view, sexual processes seem to have arosen early in the evolution of eukaryotes and be widespread, even though observations of such mechanisms among protists are scarce (Speijer et al. 2015, Goodenough & Heitman 2014). The molecular basis of sexuality is linked to 2 cellular mechanisms: meiotic division (i.e. reduction of cell ploidy) and gamete fusion (i.e. restoration of cell ploidy to pre-meiotic stages) (Speijer et al. 2015, Goodenough & Heitman 2014).

For Rhizaria that are a tedious lineage to cultivate, genetic cues can help understand the reproductive mechanisms involved in their mysterious life cycle. Sexual reproduction has been observed among some cultivable rhizarian lineages (Phytomyxea and benthic Foraminifera) but remains enigmatic for Radiolaria. The existence of a sexual cycle has long been speculated, notably by Schewiakoff ~100 years ago. Since then, the lifespan, ploidy and role of each radiolarian life stage observed on the field remain to be resolved.

The present github includes the code for identifying reference protist genes specific to gamete and meiotic life stages based on single-cell transcriptomes of Radiolaria.
